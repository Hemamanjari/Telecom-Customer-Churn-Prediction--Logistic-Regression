# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction--Logistic-Regression
Analyzed telecom customer data to identify churn patterns using Logistic Regression. Discovered key drivers behind customer attrition and provided actionable business insights for improving retention.

                          Project Overview
              This project focuses on predicting “customer churn” in the telecom industry using “Logistic Regression”.  
By analyzing customer demographics, service usage patterns, and subscription details, the goal is to identify customers most likely to discontinue services and help the business take proactive retention actions.  

              The project demonstrates the complete “data science pipeline” — from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to feature engineering and model evaluation.
              
                          Objectives
                - Understand key factors contributing to “customer churn” in the telecom sector.  
                - Apply “Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)” to identify patterns in customer demographics, usage, and plan details.  
                - Build a “Logistic Regression model” to predict churn probability.  
                - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as “Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score”, and “ROC-AUC”.  
                - Provide “business insights” and actionable recommendations for customer retention.  

                          Steps Performed
                1. “Data Understanding & Cleaning”  
                           - Loaded the dataset, checked for null values, outliers, and inconsistencies.  
                           - Standardized categorical variables and encoded features for modeling.
                
                2. “Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)”  
                           - Uncovered trends in churn rates across “contract types, tenure, payment methods, and service usage”.  
                           - Visualized churn distribution using “Matplotlib” and “Seaborn”.
                        
                3. “Feature Engineering & Selection”  
                           - Created relevant features to improve model performance.  
                           - Scaled numeric variables and encoded categorical variables.  
                
                4. “Model Building – Logistic Regression”  
                           - Built and trained a “Logistic Regression model” to predict churn.  
                           - Handled class imbalance (if present) using techniques like “SMOTE” or class weighting.
                
                5. “Model Evaluation”  
                           - Measured model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
                           - Analyzed confusion matrix for churn prediction effectiveness.  
                
                6. “Business Insights & Recommendations”  
                           - Identified high-risk churn segments.  
                           - Suggested customer retention strategies such as loyalty rewards, better plans, and proactive outreach.
                           
                                       Key Insights
                - Customers with “month-to-month contracts” have a much higher churn rate compared to long-term subscribers.  
                - Churn is more prevalent among users with “high monthly charges” but “low tenure”.  
                - “Automatic payment methods” correlate with lower churn rates.  
                - Service quality and pricing structure strongly influence customer retention.
